 			What is Female Circumcision?
 		</h1>
 		<p>
 			Female Circumcision in other words (Female Gential Mutilation) has continuously been in practice as a control of female sexuality in cultures. The partial or total removal of the female’s external genitalia that generally has been an element of a rite of passage preparing young girls for womanhood and marriage questions the ethical implications of this procedure performed on women’s bodies. <br> <br>
 			Despite the severe risk and the consequences of health and well-being on the women’s body, the practice of female circumcision continues to still present as a cultural and ethical identity in many communities as a religious obligation.
